## Changing style
Download the `<style>.imstyle180` you would like to use and place in `<GW2>/addons/Nexus/Styles`. You can then select it from the Presets dropdown.

OR

Copy the contents from `<style>.imstyle180` you would like to use and paste into the Import dialog.

Don't forget to save!

Keep in mind, the styles do NOT contain the fonts. Those have to be downloaded separately and placed into `<GW2>/addons/Nexus/Fonts`.
